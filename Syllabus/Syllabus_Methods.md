This course will cover two categories of computational tools:

1. General-purpose tools for getting research done in the ever-more-computer-savvy environment of research-based economics.  So, stuff like shell scripting (so that you can direct the computer to do a sequence of research tasks repetitively for you while you go off to sleep or to party, or whatever); collaborative development using git and related tools (basically, how to coordinate your work with coauthors, research assistants, and others); integration of LaTeX and empirical and theoretical work (so that there is a tight connection between the content of your paper and the underlying mathematics and the empirical work); reproducibility of results (designing workflows so that when you return to a project months or years later, you will have some hope of being able to reproduce the same results you had in the version of the paper that you shipped off to a journal -- or that you published.

0. The use of a specific suite of tools for solving dynamic stochastic intertemporal choice models with a continuous choice and state variable (e.g., consumption and wealth) of the kind that are increasingly popular in macroeconomics and structural micro, involving consumption and labor and financial decisions.  These will be taught using the HARK toolkit that I helped bring into existence during my term as Chief Economist at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

There are no required readings for the course. The assignments are designed to provide hands-on experience on the topics that will be discussed in class.

<!-- The TA will set up a Google Group for the class, which will serve as a forum for questions and answers among yourselves. Please send to the TA the email address that you want to be linked to that group. -->

The grade for the course will be based on assignments (once every week or so) and a final project.  Topics that will be covered include those below, but they do not
neatly separate into self-contained segments; we will be learning about many of
these topics at multiple different points in the class.  Nonetheless, the points
are roughly in the order in which we will tackle them.

1. *Creating Virtual Machines*
    * Whatever operating system your computer has, it can host a guest operating system. For example, you can work in Linux from your Mac or PC. This	is achieved through virtual machines (VMs). You will learn how to create and configure a virtual machine using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), a virtualization tool. You will also see what is the relationship between VirtualBox, and how to link a Dropbox account to your virtual machine.

5. *Collaborating using GitHub*

   * Git is a version control system. GitHub is a web-based service for collaborative projects, which is built on top of Git and has a user-friendly platform. You will learn what is a GitHub repository and basic GitHub terminology like commit, issue, fork, branch, push, pull request, and merge.

2. *Introduction to Linux and the Terminal*
    * Linux is an operating system that is mainly operated by commands using an interface known as the Terminal, a powerful tool. You will learn how to navigate in a Linux environment and the basic commands to interact with the Linux Terminal: pwd, ls, cd, rm, cp, mv, mkdir, rmdir, locate, clear.

3. *Emacs and Bash Scripts*
    * Emacs can be used as a text editor but can also	be used	to write in LaTeX and in programming languages such as Python. It can even be used as a file manager, or as a way to read your email.
    * A shell is a program that gives	an interface (usually a command line interface) to interact with the operating system. The Bash shell is the default shell in Linux and a command language. A Bash shell script is a program written in the bash programming language. Bash scripts are a powerful tool to automate repetitive tasks like installing software, generating your CV or assembling a research paper.

0. *Git, Github, etc*
   * Git is a version control system created by the author of Linux (Linus Torvalds), as proof that he really is a genius.

4. *Markdown, LaTeX and TexLive*
   * Markdown is a markup language, which provides a simple way to write and format easy-to-read text (plaintext). You can easily create lists and tables, insert web links, and display blocks of code (with sintax highlighting) in different languages.

   * You will learn how to interact with Markdown and bash sripts, as well as how to automate the generation of PDF and HTML documents using different file extensions (for example, .tex files).

6. *Introduction to Python and HARK*
   * Python is an open-source, high-level, general-purpose programming language, that is widely used, including for scientific computing. In this part of the course you will learn about object-oriented programming, parallel computing, Jupyter notebooks (a way to interact with Python from a web browser), the iPython shell, and we will follow material from the popular [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) site.

   * Finally, you will be introduced to the HARK toolkit, a specific suite of tools for solving dynamic stochastic intertemporal choice models, which are increasingly popular in macroeconomics and structural microeconomics, involving consumption, labor and financial decisions.
